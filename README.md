<!-- ```
this part is still WIP
``` -->

<!-- `A sentence about who and what you are.`  -->

A junior software developer and graduate of [Makers Academy](#education).\
My background combines the hard-working logical thoroughness of working in [pharmaceutical research](#experience) with experience of customer service and working to client demands.

<!-- `Then a sentence about what you've achieved.`

```
This is difficult because I feel like I don't have any achievements I'm really
 proud of or that I can speak about. What sort of stuff is even appropriate to
  put here? It seems like any time I think I have the start of an idea it's:

  - not something that can be made snappy, and
  - something that will be covered in pretty much the next section...

ok I get that this bit is supposed to be the part that summarises the rest of 
the document and that it's therefore ok to repeat some of the language here 
later (while elaborating on it later) but I don't know where to draw the line
```

`And then a sentence about what exictes you about tech.` -->

I'm very excited about how the world of tech has created so many new ways to improve the lives of people all around the world. From large-scale ecological projects benifiting the natural world to the fact that banking is now a bit easier; real people are seeing real advantages based on the work of developers everywhere.

## [^](#john-baxter)Skills

<!-- `
Consider skills relevent to software development. Then consider your best skills. Pick 2-4 skills and write a short descriptive paragraph for each one. You should demonstrate how capable you are at this skill with examples.
` -->

### **Attention to detail**

<!-- `paragraph`\ -->
In my previous role as a lab technician, one of my responsibilities was to proof-read technical documents relating to testing of samples. This took the form of homogenising the tone and language style of documents that may have been written over extended periods of time by several individuals; and conceptualising what was actually being asked for to make sure that there was some degree of flow and that instructions were in a sensible order. 
This has influenced my decision to change career, as this is a very useful skill to have as a software developer. Understanding how small steps flow together helps with building complex algorithms from small functions, and being able to spot small discrepancies in language use is great for debugging code.

<!-- - `Experience` -->
- Developed a reputation for being the main reliable person to do this task
<!-- - `Achievements` -->
- Made lab testing more efficient and straightforward for several projects; including on behalf of teams I was not a member of.
<!-- - `Evidence` -->
<!-- - ??  -->

### **Fast learner**

<!-- `Descriptive paragraph of how capable you are at this skill and, if relevant, how it has developed.` -->

Learning quickly is something that has helped me throughout my life. Working on multiple projects in various labs requires getting to grips with different lab equipment on a regular basis; and it is fairly typical for different clients and colleagues to have subtly different styles and requirements. Also in my leisure time: board games and video games both must be understood pretty well if I'm to avoid coming in last place.
Fast learning is best illustrated by how I was able to succesfully navigate the coding bootcamp from a starting point of having no knowledge or understanding at all, and ending less than one year later in a position where I am managing my own projects and able to sucessfully try out new languages.

<!-- - `I achieved A during my work at B (job, or otherwise)` -->
- While working at Cambridge consultants, I was the resident expert for using the 
[force testing equipment][mecmesin], 
a position I developed rapidly after it featured prominently in the first project I was involved in.
<!-- - `I contributed to the growth of X while doing Y (job, or otherwise)` -->
<!-- -  -->
<!-- - `I built this, made this, broke this, fixed this, etc.` -->
- I have demonstrated my ability to learn quickly throughout my academic career. Understanding the complicated concepts involved in chemistry when each module only lasts for two months; and getting to grips with the nuances of a programming language I've never heard of in preparation to attend the bootcamp.
<!-- - `A link to some on-line evidence (blogs, videos, articles, etc.)` -->
- Some evidence of how my coding has progressed over time can be seen in my 
[codewars profile][codewars-killie-skank]
and the 
[GitHub repository][project-euler-gh]
containing the work I've done on project Euler

### **Teamworking**

```
I've copied and pasted this from above because the template only had space for two. 
I also changed 'descriptive' to 'short'.

## [^](#john-baxter)Hobbies

I like to contrast my busy tech work-life with stepping away from the screen and keyboard in my leisure time. A lot of what I do for fun could be described as traditional or old-fashioned. I also enjoy learning lots of information about a diverse range of subjects, so when something interests me I am likely to find something to read about it.

- Cooking is a nice activity to help wind down at the end of a busy day. I enjoy taking my time over the process, and experimenting with flavours. Eating delicious food at the end is also a bonus - and if something hasn't worked out, well that's what Tabasco is for. 

- Watching lower league (and non-league) football is a fun passtime for a Saturday afternoon. Going to a small stadium and getting involved with the local community is what I consider 'real' football. It's nice to be far removed from the TV cameras and million-pound advertising contracts.

- Learning languages is a good way to keep the brain active; so alongside Ruby, Python et al. I can also say: \
He estado aprendiendo español desde hace dos años.

- Practicing circus skills like juggling or whip-cracking is a physical passtime best enjoyed in a field with friends. I regularly attend an organised event in Warwickshire where I can learn how to balance objects on my chin, and even try things like archery. It's also a great way to meet loads of interesting people.



<!-- ```
I have no idea how to do this part. I want to lean towards the fact that I prefer 
low-tech or even tech-free stuff.

-Stuff like gardening, cooking or DIY using only hand tools and traditional/old 
fashioned methods
-Other stuff like how I like lower league football to get the community feel and 
none of the nonsense around TV replays and huge commercial/advertising interest
-I was also thinking about writing a sentence about learning Spanish; but 
writing it actually in Spanish. (he estado aprendiendo español desde hace dos años (I think 
this is close))
-Also maybe a bit about flow art, circus skills and weapon skills

My difficulty is in finding how to write this in a way that captures what I'm 
trying to say while being interesting to a casual observer (difficult because 
people are generally not interested in my hobbies) and without making it far 
too long.
```

```
below is how it was on my old CV:
```
- Reading: non-fiction, popular science and science fiction.
- Board games, e.g. Carcassonne, Lords of Waterdeep and Codenames.
- Watching sport, e.g. football, cricket and rugby league.
- Trivia and pub quizzes, especially geography and sport.
- Learning Spanish (post-beginner level). -->
